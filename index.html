    <p>She's been a part of my life since she was about 2-3 weeks old and is now 11 months old, wow, it's amazing to see how much she has grown. this is my first cat so I used this <a href="https://cats.com/" target ="_blank">website</a> to help me in my cat journey</p>
    
    <h2>Now this is the Top 3 things she does for the house</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Sleep all day!</strong> She does nothing but sleep, while doing this she is sleeping on her cat bed next to me</li>
        <li><strong>Scratch me!</strong> I've gotten at least one new scar every week trying to play with her and I have the marks to show it :D</li>
        <li><strong>Makes me scoop her poop!</strong> She poops in a box and I pick it up, not much more to explain D:</li>
